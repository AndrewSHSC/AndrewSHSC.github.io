                <p class='e-job'>Research Scientist</p>
                <p class='preamble'>I joined BMT as a graduate in 2010, with bachelor's and master's degrees in Engineering
                  from the University of Cambridge. One of the things that attracted me to the company was the variety in
                  research work.</p>
                <p>The research environment here in BMT is fairly unusual in that we are all working largely independently
                  on our own projects. Most of my current projects are in the field of transport and logistics. They include
                  the development of a security information system to protect the container supply chain, and the development
                  of a human machine interface for a sensor fusion platform, that can be used to detect threats to mobile
                  assets, such as trucks and ships.</p>
                <p>As part of the e-Freight project, I was responsible for developing and piloting a National Single Window
                  (NSW) system in Latvia. A NSW provides a single interface for transport operators to report to national
                  authorities, such as customs, for regulation purposes. Also as part of e-Freight, I have been developing
                  an electronic waybill solution to replace the paper documents that currently accompany cargo during transportation.</p>
                <p>In another project, called e-MAR, I am developing the NSW concept further for the maritime industry by
                  extending it with tools and services to support management of ships and crew, inspection, navigation and
                  maintenance.</p>

                <h2>John Smith</h2>
                <p class='e-job'>Research Scientist</p>
                <p class='preamble'>I joined BMT as a graduate in 2010, with bachelor's and master's degrees in Engineering
                  from the University of Cambridge. One of the things that attracted me to the company was the variety in
                  research work.</p>
                <p>The research environment here in BMT is fairly unusual in that we are all working largely independently
                  on our own projects. Most of my current projects are in the field of transport and logistics. They include
                  the development of a security information system to protect the container supply chain, and the development
                  of a human machine interface for a sensor fusion platform, that can be used to detect threats to mobile
                  assets, such as trucks and ships.</p>
                <p>As part of the e-Freight project, I was responsible for developing and piloting a National Single Window
                  (NSW) system in Latvia. A NSW provides a single interface for transport operators to report to national
                  authorities, such as customs, for regulation purposes. Also as part of e-Freight, I have been developing
                  an electronic waybill solution to replace the paper documents that currently accompany cargo during transportation.</p>
                <p>In another project, called e-MAR, I am developing the NSW concept further for the maritime industry by
                  extending it with tools and services to support management of ships and crew, inspection, navigation and
                  maintenance.</p>
